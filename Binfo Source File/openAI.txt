APPLICATION
EU students: February - August

Admission to the BINFO programme is possible for every candidate with a university entrance degree, sufficient language background (level B1 in French and B2 in English), and motivation for learning about mathematics and computer science. Candidates with excellent mathematical background, but non-sufficient language skills, are nevertheless invited to apply, since specific language courses are offered in the Language Center of the University to help beginner students to improve their language skills.

Mobility Semester 
The aforementioned law on the university defines in Art 36 (6) that for Bachelor students a mobility semester in a foreign country is mandatory (with only few exceptions for students in special situations). The mobility semester for BINFO students can be chosen as either Semester 3 or Semester 4. For a student doing his/her mobility, the respective regular semester programme is replaced by a list of courses given at the host institution, defined together by the student and the study director before the start of the mobility semester. Technical details are available on a dedicated page on our Moodle platform.
Exemption from the semester abroad

In the following cases, the Dean grants an exemption from the mobility requirement after consultation with the Director of Studies:

in the case of students with an illness that requires special treatment and/or students with a disability that significantly limits their mobility;

in the case of family commitments which prevent the student from being away from the family for an extended period of time (Rectorate decision of 8 May 2006);

in the case of students from a third country outside the European Economic Area who can provide evidence of a university degree in a country that does not belong to the European Economic Area (Rectorate decision of 10 July 2007);

in the case of proof of employment for the study period of at least 20 hours per week.

Students who are exempt from the mobility requirement are:
those who can present a degree in which at least 4 semesters of the study period were spent abroad;


those who have obtained at least 25 ECTS credits at a foreign university, which must be recognised by the Director of Studies (these ECTS credits count for one semester).

The Bachelor project realizes an at least 12 weeks long, full time, individual project in the IT domain either done in a professional partner institution (for more professionally interested students) or within a research group of the CS department (for more research-oriented students).
Students are integrated in a team in the partner institution / research group and shall apply the IT knowledge achieved during their study in a practically relevant (sub)-project in this institution. A Bachelor thesis with a project description, achieved results and practical work experiences made must be written at the end of the project and defended in front of a jury. 

One of the qualifications required to undertake the bachelor project, is that the student must have successfully completed all modules of the first two semesters of the program (in case, successful completion of only a single course of the first two semesters is missing, the Study Director can grant an exemption in case the student participates in the exam for this course during the last exam session before the expected start of the Bachelor project).
