Meeting notes

Date: 08/03/2023

Starting time: 10:35

Participants: Fardous SADEQ, Pol KIHN.

Content: discussing the potential ideas of the project.

Two main ideas were discussed.
The first one was about an interactive and informative game, which we didn’t specify as we didn’t go further deep in it.
The second idea was about creating a chatbot, a utility that provides students with information about the university of Luxembourg in general, and about BINFO in particular.

Decision taken: the chatbot idea was chosen to perform a feasibility study on it, and the project idea was found to be technically feasible.
The timetable was discussed and set up. The PPT for the next course meeting was prepared.

Ending time: 12:20
